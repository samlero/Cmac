Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC)
An artificial neural network implemented for control system use cases. 
The Cmac class in each language implement the following methods:
1. Predict: calculates a prediction based on the given state input.
2. Train: adjusts the weights based on a correction term.
3. Save: save the weights and parameters of the current instance.
4. Load: a static method to create an instance of a Cmac from a saved file.
