A C++ based Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) implementation in the context of control systems. 
The implemented CMAC has two main methods:
1. Predict - it acquires all the active weights and their associated basis function values, then they are multiplied and summed.
2. Adjust - trains the active weights.

**API**
1. C++
2. MATLAB (MEX) - must manually rebuild
3. Python - TBD
4. Julia - TBD
